0x1C. C - Makefiles

The make utility requires a file, Makefile (or makefile ), which defines set of tasks to be executed. You may have used make to compile a program from source code. Most open source projects use make to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using make install .

How to Install make?
1. sudo apt upadate - to upadate the operating system
2. make -version to check if make is installed or not
3. sudo apt install make if is not installed.
4. ls /usr/bin/make to check for the make directory.
