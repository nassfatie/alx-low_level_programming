0x12-singly_linked_lists
Linked lists are linear structures. Think of boxes in a straight line with arrows in between each box. Each box is a node containing information and a reference (pointer) to the next node. The arrows link the nodes together. This structure begins with the head, which points to the first node in the sequence.
